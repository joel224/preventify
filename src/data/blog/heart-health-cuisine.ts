      <p>South Indian cuisine, with its emphasis on rice, lentils, and vegetables, can be incredibly heart-healthy when prepared traditionally. The cuisine typically features less oil and dairy compared to North Indian counterparts, making it a great option for those conscious about heart health.</p>
      <h2>Heart-Healthy Ingredients</h2>
      <p>Several staple ingredients in South Indian cooking offer cardiovascular benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coconut: Contains medium-chain triglycerides that may help reduce bad cholesterol</li>
        <li>Curry Leaves: Rich in antioxidants and may help control blood sugar levels</li>
        <li>Turmeric: Contains curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory properties</li>
        <li>Tamarind: High in antioxidants and may help lower cholesterol</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Beneficial Cooking Methods</h2>
      <p>Many South Indian dishes are steamed, boiled, or lightly tempered rather than deep-fried, making them lower in unhealthy fats. The liberal use of spices adds flavor without the need for excess salt, which is beneficial for blood pressure management.</p>
      <h2>Recommended Dishes</h2>
      <p>Some heart-healthy South Indian options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Idli - Steamed rice cakes that are easily digestible and low in calories</li>
        <li>Sambar - Lentil soup with vegetables rich in protein and fiber</li>
        <li>Rasam - Tamarind-based soup with antioxidant-rich spices</li>
        <li>Avial - Mixed vegetables cooked with coconut and yogurt</li>
      </ul>
