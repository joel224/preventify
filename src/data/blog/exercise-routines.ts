      <p>In today's fast-paced world, finding time for exercise can be challenging. However, even short bursts of physical activity can significantly impact your health and well-being. This article presents simple, time-efficient exercise routines specifically designed for busy professionals.</p>
      <h2>The 7-Minute HIIT Workout</h2>
      <p>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) allows you to get maximum benefits in minimum time. This scientifically proven 7-minute circuit includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>30 seconds of jumping jacks</li>
        <li>30 seconds of wall sits</li>
        <li>30 seconds of push-ups</li>
        <li>30 seconds of abdominal crunches</li>
        <li>30 seconds of step-ups</li>
        <li>30 seconds of squats</li>
        <li>30 seconds of triceps dips</li>
        <li>30 seconds of plank</li>
        <li>30 seconds of high knees running in place</li>
        <li>30 seconds of lunges</li>
        <li>30 seconds of push-up with rotation</li>
        <li>30 seconds of side plank (each side)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rest for 10 seconds between each exercise. The entire routine takes just 7 minutes and requires no special equipment beyond a chair and a wall.</p>
      <h2>Desk-Based Exercise</h2>
      <p>For days when you can't step away from your desk:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Seated leg raises: Straighten one leg and hold for 2 seconds; lower it without letting it touch the floor. Repeat 15 times, then switch legs.</li>
        <li>Chair squats: Stand up from your chair, lower yourself until you're barely touching the seat, then stand again. Repeat 10-15 times.</li>
        <li>Desk push-ups: Place hands on the edge of your desk, walk feet back, and perform push-ups. Complete 10-15 repetitions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Walking Meetings</h2>
      <p>Transform your meetings into walking sessions when possible. A 30-minute walking meeting can help you achieve nearly one-third of your daily recommended physical activity.</p>
      <p>Remember, consistency is more important than intensity. Even these short exercise routines, performed regularly, can lead to significant health improvements over time.</p>
