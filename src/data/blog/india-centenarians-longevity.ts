      <p>Imagine meeting someone who has lived through two world wars, seen India gain independence, witnessed the digital revolution, and is still going strong at 100 years old. These aren't just remarkable individuals - they're living textbooks of longevity.</p>
      <p>A new study looking at India's oldest citizens has revealed some surprising truths about what it really takes to live a long, healthy life. And the best part? Their secrets aren't complicated or expensive. They're simple habits that any of us can start practicing today.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-preventify-blue">The Health Habits of India's 100-Year-Olds</h2>
      <p>When researchers studied centenarians across India, they found something remarkable: most of these 100-year-olds were actually in good health. No fancy medical treatments or expensive supplements - just basic lifestyle choices that made all the difference.</p>
      <p>Here's what stood out:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>They Stay Lean, Not Overweight:</strong> More than half of India's centenarians maintain a healthy weight. About 55% have a normal BMI, and over 91% have a healthy waist size - including every single female centenarian studied. Not one of them was overweight or had a high waist measurement.</li>
        <li><strong>They Avoid Chronic Diseases:</strong> Think about this: among these 100-year-olds, there were zero cases of high cholesterol, stroke, or heart disease. Only 1.7% had diabetes. This isn't luck - it's lifestyle.</li>
        <li><strong>They Skip the Bad Stuff:</strong> Over 90% of centenarians never drank alcohol. About 68% never smoked tobacco. They didn't need willpower to quit bad habits because they never started them in the first place.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These findings tell us something powerful: the path to longevity isn't about expensive treatments or miracle pills. It's about avoiding the major health risks that cut lives short.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-preventify-blue">Living Well at 100: Support Makes All the Difference</h2>
      <p>At 100 years young, daily life looks different. Many centenarians find that having a helping hand with everyday activities makes life more comfortable and enjoyable. Things like housework, managing finances, or even finding their way around town become easier with a little support from family, community, or modern conveniences.</p>
      <p>The beautiful thing is that most of these 100-year-olds are women who have built rich lives in rural communities. Their wisdom and experience are treasures we can all learn from. With the right support systems in place - like community care programs, accessible transportation, and simple technology aids - they continue to live with dignity and purpose.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-preventify-blue">The Happiness Factor: Why Attitude Matters</h2>
      <p>Here's where things get really inspiring. Despite needing some assistance with daily tasks, most centenarians report being happy and satisfied with life:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>51% say they have high life satisfaction</li>
        <li>37% report moderate satisfaction</li>
        <li>Over 75% believe they are both healthy and happy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This happiness isn't accidental. Many centenarians stay connected through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Daily spiritual practices like yoga and meditation</li>
        <li>Community gatherings at temples, mosques, and churches</li>
        <li>Sharing their wisdom by helping with childcare or teaching</li>
        <li>Maintaining strong family bonds</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-preventify-blue">What This Means For You and Your Family</h2>
