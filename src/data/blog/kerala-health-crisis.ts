      <p>Let's talk about something we all see but rarely discuss: Many of us feel tired all the time but blame it on work stress. our health is changing. In Kerala today, even young friends are getting diagnosed with diabetes and heart problems much earlier than before.</p>
      
      <p>Here's the hard truth: Kerala now has some of the highest rates of lifestyle diseases in India. Nearly 9 crore Indians have diabetes, and Kerala contributes significantly to this number. Heart disease is stealing our loved ones in their 40s and 50s. And the scary part? About 65 out of every 100 people have fatty liver without knowing it.</p>
      
      <p>But this isn't just statistics. This is about Appachan who missed his grandson's wedding because of a heart attack. This is about Amma who now needs insulin injections three times a day. This is about our children growing up with health problems we never had at their age.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-preventify-blue">Why Are Malayalis Getting Sick So Young?</h2>
      
      <p>Think about our grandparents. They walked to work, ate fresh fish curry with rice from our fields, and their snacks were bananas and tender coconuts. Today, our lives look completely different.</p>
      
      <p>We sit in offices all day. Our lunch boxes contain parotta and chicken instead of fresh fish and vegetables. Our tea breaks mean biscuits and fried snacks instead of fruits. When we feel exhausted, we think it's normal - not a warning sign.</p>
      
      <p>The real problem is our changing food culture. We've replaced our traditional meals of fish curry, avial, and thoran with processed foods. Even our beloved appam now comes with sugar-laden stews instead of healthy vegetable curries. Weekend family meals have become elaborate affairs with multiple fried items instead of simple, nourishing food.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-preventify-blue">Real Health Changes That Work for Kerala Families</h2>
      
      <p>I learned this the hard way when my father had a heart attack at 54. He was the strongest man I knew - ran his business, played cricket with us on Sundays. That day changed everything for our family.</p>
      
      <p>Here's what actually works for us:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sunday Morning Market Ritual:</strong> Every Sunday, we visit the local market together as a family. We buy fresh fish, seasonal vegetables, and coconut. My children help choose the ingredients. This small habit ensures we have healthy food for the week and reconnects us with our food sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Evening Walks Replace Evening Tea:</strong> Instead of sitting with tea and snacks at 5 PM, we now take a 30-minute walk around our neighborhood. Sometimes we walk to the temple or beach. This simple change has improved our sleep, reduced stress, and given us real family time without phones.</li>
        <li><strong>The Check-Up That Saved My Neighbor:</strong> My neighbor Kochamma always said, "If God wants, I'll be fine." But during a free health camp organized by our Kudumbashree unit, they found her sugar levels were dangerously high. With simple diet changes and regular walking, she's now off medication completely.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-preventify-blue">Why Kerala's Community Spirit Is Our Greatest Health Asset</h2>

      <p>Kerala has always been special because of our community bonds. Our Kudumbashree groups don't just make pickles - they look out for each other's health. Our local temples and churches run regular health camps. Our neighbors notice when someone looks unwell and speak up.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-preventify-blue">Your Health Questions, Answered for Kerala Life</h2>
      <div class="space-y-4">
        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Q: How often should working people get checked?</h3>
          <p>A: If you're over 30, get basic tests once a year. If you have family history of diabetes or heart disease, start at 25.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Q: What if I can't afford regular health checks?</h3>
          <p>A: Kerala's public health system offers free screenings. Kudumbashree units organize monthly camps. Your local ASHA worker can guide you to free services near you.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Q: I work long hours - how can I stay healthy?</h3>
          <p>A: Start with small changes. Take the stairs instead of lift. Keep fruits at work instead of biscuits. Walk for 10 minutes during lunch break. These small habits add up.</p>

      </div>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-preventify-blue">The Bottom Line: Our Health Is Our Family's Future</h2>
      
      <p>In Kerala, family comes first. We work hard for our children's education, save for their weddings, plan for their future. But what good is any of that if we're not healthy to see it happen?</p>
      
      <p>Preventive health isn't about giving up our culture. It's about returning to our roots - fresh food, active living, community support. It's about making choices today so we can be there for our families tomorrow.</p>
