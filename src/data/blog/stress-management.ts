      <p>In our increasingly connected world, stress has become a common experience for many. Chronic stress can negatively impact both physical and mental health, contributing to conditions such as hypertension, heart disease, anxiety, and depression. Mindfulness—the practice of maintaining awareness of the present moment—offers a powerful tool for managing stress.</p>
      <h2>What is Mindfulness?</h2>
      <p>Mindfulness involves paying attention to the present moment with openness, curiosity, and acceptance. Instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, mindfulness encourages engagement with what's happening right now.</p>
      <h2>Scientific Benefits</h2>
      <p>Research has shown that regular mindfulness practice can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce stress hormones like cortisol</li>
        <li>Lower blood pressure</li>
        <li>Improve sleep quality</li>
        <li>Enhance immune function</li>
        <li>Increase focus and attention</li>
        <li>Reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Simple Mindfulness Practices</h2>
      <h3>1. Mindful Breathing (5 minutes)</h3>
      <p>Sit comfortably with your back straight. Close your eyes and focus on your breath—the sensation of air entering and leaving your nostrils or the rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. When your mind wanders (which it will), gently bring attention back to your breath without judgment.</p>
      <h3>2. Body Scan (10 minutes)</h3>
      <p>Lie down in a comfortable position. Bring awareness to different parts of your body, starting from your toes and moving up to your head. Notice any sensations without trying to change them.</p>
      <h3>3. Mindful Walking (15 minutes)</h3>
      <p>Walk slowly and deliberately, paying attention to the sensation of each foot touching and lifting from the ground. Notice the movement of your body and the environment around you.</p>
      <p>At Preventify, we offer mindfulness workshops and one-on-one sessions to help you develop a sustainable practice for stress management and improved wellbeing.</p>
